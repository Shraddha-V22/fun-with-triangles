# fun-with-triangles

A fun project made with VanillaJs. It will test your knowlegde of triangles and will also give some tools to calculate area of a triangle and length of hypotenuse.  
It was difficult to place the footer attached to the bottom due to lack of content on a page. if the viewport will increase the footer won't stay at the bottom. If you can help me with that then do contact.
